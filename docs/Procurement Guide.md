 # Procurement Guide
For most people wanting to complete this project with a group, Element14 (au.element14.com) is the best place to acquire components from. They are based in Australia, and have pricing very similar to buying directly from suppliers overseas using a site such as Alibaba. 

Key characteristics that are needed when finding components:
- LEDs – through-hole, 3mm casing
- Push buttons – case dimensions of 6x6mm, 4 legs, through-hole, single-pole single-throw (SPST)
- Buzzer - Ensure the buzzer supports 3V, and the legs are 5mm apart. 
- Resistors – resistance of 51ohm, through-hole. Does not need to be more than 500mW or have a resistance tolerance of less than 1-2%. 
- Battery Holder - Make sure the diameter of the holder is 20mm if you want to use CR2032 or CR2025 batteries (both very common) and that the two legs on the holder are 20mm apart. Also, ensure the batteries you are using, if different to the ones listed, output 3V. 

Below is a list of parts that were available at the time of writing that would be suitable for this project:
