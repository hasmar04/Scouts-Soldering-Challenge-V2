 # Procurement Guide
For most people wanting to complete this project with a group, Element14 (au.element14.com) is the best place to acquire components from. They are based in Australia, and have pricing very similar to buying directly from suppliers overseas using a site such as Alibaba. 

Key characteristics that are needed when finding components:
- Arduino Nano – headers attached (pins along the sides)
- LEDs – through-hole, 3mm casing
- Push button – case dimensions of 6x6mm, 4 legs, through-hole, single-pole single-throw (SPST)
- Resistors – resistances of 330ohm and 1kohm, through-hole. Does not need to be more than 500mW or have a resistance tolerance of less than 1%. 
- Barrel Jack - Make sure the diameter of the inner pin is the same as the power supply you want to use. Also, ensure the power supply is 5V output. 

Below is a list of parts that were available at the time of writing that would be suitable for this project:
- 3mm Red LED - https://au.element14.com/kingbright/l-1334surtk/led-3mm-red-630nm-red-transparent/dp/4062027

If these parts are not available, there should be similar components available. Element14 also has the option to search for similar products based of characteristics like size and colour.
