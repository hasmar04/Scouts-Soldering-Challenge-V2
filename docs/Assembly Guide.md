# Assembly Guide
## Before Proceeding
Ensure that you have all components listed in the [Procurement Guide](https://github.com/hasmar04/Scouts-Soldering-Challenge-V2/blob/main/docs/Procurement%20Guide.md), as well as a soldering iron and some solder. Lead-free solder is recommended, although it does require a higher temperature on the soldering iron. 
## Step 1: Sort Components Into Sets
This is recommended to be done before the night to make it easier to get the Scouts started on the project. Check out the [README](../README.md) for the list of required components. 
## Step 2: Start with the Resistors
It is always a good idea to start with the flattest components, which in this project are the resistors. There is no wrong orientation to install them. Poke the legs of the resistor through the holes, trying to make it as flat against the PCB as possible. Once in place, solder from the back side of the PCB and cut the excess legs off with sidecutters. 
## Step 3: Move onto the LEDs
The LEDs are the next tallest components, and require slighly more care than the resistors to install. Ensure the short leg of the LED goes to the square pad, putting it the other way around will not work. The legs can be bent to hold it in place. Once soldered in place, cut off extra leg length with sidecutters. For future reference, the square pad is typically for Ground, and the round pad for Power. The short leg of the LED is always for Ground, while the long leg is for Power. 
## Step 4: Insert and Solder the Buttons
The buttons have no polarity, and can go in either way. It should grab onto the PCB, making soldering it in place a breeze. Once soldered, and excess leg can be removed if desired. 
## Step 5: Solder the Battery Holder into Place
The battery holder only goes one way, so make sure to line it up with the outline on the PCB. Once soldered in place, cut off any extra leg length if necessary. 
## Step 6: Solder the Buzzer into Place
The tallest component is the buzzer, and it can only go one way. Make sure the positive side of the buzzer goes to the square pad. Solder in place, then cut off any extra leg length if required. 
## Step 7: Test!
Insert a battery and check that the lights turn on and the buzzer works when the buttons are pressed.
